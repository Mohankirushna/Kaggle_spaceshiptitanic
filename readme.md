# Spaceship Titanic - Survival Prediction

This project focuses on predicting passenger survival aboard the fictional Spaceship Titanic, using machine learning techniques on passenger data.

## 🚀 Overview
The goal is to build a classification model to predict whether a passenger survived based on features like age, cabin, passenger class, and other attributes.

## 🛠️ Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handling missing data
- Feature engineering and encoding categorical variables
- Training classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC metrics

## 💻 Usage
1. Load the Spaceship Titanic dataset.
2. Run the notebook/script to preprocess data, train, and evaluate the model.
3. Predict survival status for new passenger data.

## ⚙️ Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- xgboost (optional)
- matplotlib / seaborn
